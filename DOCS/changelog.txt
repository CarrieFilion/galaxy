Jan 27, 2017  New version: v15

* The main improvement is the elimination of all commercial software,
  in particular of the NAG library.  Calls to routines in this
  commercial software package have been replaced by calls to open
  access software.  In many cases, the substituted routine is
  identical to the NAG version, which was simply a front that passed
  the call to an open access routine from QUADPACK or LAPACK for
  example.  In other cases, equivalents have been found from various
  sources, such as FFTPACK, CMLIB, or the valuable software portal
  maintained by John Burkardt.

* The addition of two alternative methods to recenter the grid.  The
  original method (1) followed the particle centroid.  The new methods
  are: (2) following the center of mass of a fixed number of the most
  tightly bound particles on each mass component, or (3) following the
  motion of an extra heavy particle initially at rest at the center.
  The performance of both these new methods seems inferior to that of
  method (1) but they are there for users who may wish to try them.

* Minor changes to the specification and handling of rigid, spherical
  external perturbers

* Many improvements to the analysis package

* Subroutine hedrec was completely rewritten


Dec 20, 2016  Updates in v14.52

* The main improvement here is to the s3d code in which the strategy
  for interpolation between grid rings was revised.  It resulted in
  minor improvements to the accuracy of the resulting forces as well
  as executing a little faster.

* Handling of Greek characters, super- and sub-scripts in the
  annotation of plots should no longer depend on the compiler used


Nov 10, 2016  Minor patch in v14.511

* This change fixes a few minor bugs in the dfiter program that failed
  when used for hybrid codes

* Fixed a bug in program smooth when multiple components have DFs

* Properly initialize two moving centers in subroutine loadup

* Fixed a bug for the hybrid option in the MPI version of massum


May 2016  Changes included in v14.50

Version 14.5 of the \softwp{GALAXY} package contains a number of
significant improvements as summarized here.  In addition, the names
of the directories have been changed.  As a consequence, there are
some slight changes to the installation procedure.

* Easier setup: A major change at this version is to separate more
  completely the part of the code related to setting up the initial
  particle distribution, from that used to compute the evolution.
  Most runs of galaxy need only a short ASCII file (.dat) to select
  parameters, and a binary (.pcs) file containing the particles.  The
  file of particles can be created in one of three ways:
  - For those wishing to take advantage of the author's set up codes,
    the particle file can be created using the program mkpcs
  - The user can create his/her own .pcs file
  - Alternatively, for those with files of particles suitable for use
    in GADGET-2, I have provided an executable to convert them to the
    format required for GALAXY.

* Program start has been retired, and programs begin and finish have
  been renamed as pcs2dmp and dmp2pcs for clarity of purpose

* Minor improvements to the .dat file 
  - The first argument to the analysis options dvel and hvel is now
    the number of radial bins per scale length of that component.
    (Previously it was the total number of radial bins, and the code
    made a sometimes inconvenient conversion.)
  - The frqs anlysis option requires a parameter which is the number
    of values to be computed per scale length.  (Previously, the
    radial spacing was the same as for the dvel bins, which was too
    limiting.)

* Program compress has been improved and extended to enable
  equilibrium bulge plus halo models, in the presence of a disk or
  other component, to be set up.

* Restrictions on the choice of mass and length scale of any component
  have been eliminated. 

* New mass components include the Einasto halo, and isotropic DFs for
  both that and the cored isothermal sphere created by Eddington
  inversion.

* The code now offers a warm disk set up by determining a DF for the
  disk by the method outlined by Shu (1969) This new capability has
  not been tested very extensively, and may require tweaks in future.

* 3D Cartesian grid.  I have included a new (f95) version of the
  Poisson solver on a 3D Cartesian grid that was kindly supplied by
  Richard James.  This new version of his software eliminates the only
  remaining arrays that were dimensioned at compilation time in
  previous versions.  Now all parts of the code use dynamically
  allocated arrays, which means that the executables provided place no
  restrictions on either the size of any grid or the number of
  particles that can be employed.

* Logical unit numbers are now assigned dynamically to ensure
  then none could ever be muddled for two different files

* Many "go to"s and long calling argument lists have been eliminated

* Two of the larger arrays have been broken into separate pieces
  making their use a little more understandable.  One consequence of
  this improvement is that the compiler bug when -O2 optimization is
  selected for the ifort compiler should have been eliminated (thanks
  to Matthieu Portail for chasing that down).

* User inputs while running program analys have been improved
  somewhat.
  - A list of available components is displayed when the user is asked
    to select one.
  - Selecting first, last, and interval is now mostly done in time
    units, instead of number of time steps.
  - Added a new option (cntd) is to create color images of the
    non-axisymmetric density on polar grids
  - The user also has the option to mark scales on some (but not yet
    all) plots in physical units

* Plotting: Calls to PGPLOT routines can now be made from the analysis
  code without the need to interface with routines written by the
  author, although the older calls also work.

* The approximate expression used in earlier versions to estimate the
  gravitational potential on the spherical grid has been replaced by
  the exact expression


September 2014  Changes included in v14.10

* Reduced use of NAG: Some progress has been made to eliminate NAG
  calls when they are not really needed.  If a mass component, either
  a disk or a halo, is described as unknown, keyword `UNKN', then a
  number of NAG calls in the set-up procedure and in the analysis
  package will be skipped, enabling the code to be used more easily by
  those who lack the NAG libary.

* A generic perturber has been added as an option, which allows the
  user to program whatever external mass distribution is desired.  All
  the particles in the code will experience the attraction of this
  perturber, and the CoM of the perturber will be moved in reaction to
  the cumulative sum of all the forces experienced by the particles.
  It is up to the user whether the model also contains frozen mass
  components that are nailed down, which may not make dynamical sense.

* A table of supplementary correction forces is usually created by
  program mkpcs.  The improvements here make it possible for the user
  to create a substitute.
  - The table is saved in a .stb file by program mkpcs and read back
    by program pcs2dmp.  It is therefore possible for the user to
    create his own file of tabulated values that can be read, along
    with a .pcs file
  - The radii at which values were tabulated depended on the adopted
    grid.  This has now been made independent of the grid.

* Fixed a bug in subroutine loadup that prevented multiple populations
  of particles from being loaded properly

* Output of some text is suppressed except on the master node
