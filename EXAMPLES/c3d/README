The files in directory invite the user to try two simulations with the
3D Cartesian grid.

             ------------------------

Run100 is a simple test run to set up a fully self-gravitating disk in
approximate equilibrium from a given .dfn

The script run100.s should set up and evolve the model for a short period.

             ------------------------

Run999 is an example that uses dfiter to set up disk + bulge model.

The first step is to run the script dfiter.s, which should create the
file run999.pft containing the potential of the disk + halo system
after the last interation

With this in hand, it is then possible to run the script smooth.s to
select particles from the DF in the equilibrium potential.  It will
create the file run999.dfn

After these two preliminary steps, the script run999.s will setup and
evolve the model for a short period.  The model should be in
approximate equilibrium.
