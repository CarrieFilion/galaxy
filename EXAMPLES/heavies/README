run100 is an example to illustrate the "heavies" option of the code

The two populations are drawn from the same parent DF: an isotropic
Plummer sphere which has the full potential of the combined two
components.  The script run100.s will create two .dfn files:
run100.df1 having 20K particles and run100.df2 having 100 particles.
When combined, the mass of each must be smaller than the total, so the
start-up procedure needs to know that the velocities of each are
already appropriate for the total potential and should not be
rescaled.  The script then implements pcs2dmp and galaxy to run this
case for a short period.  Because the direct-N option is used for the
heavy particles, this code has not been parallelized.

The model is not in perfect equilibrium because the potential of the
heavy particles is softened.  Using the supplementary correction
forces option is not recommended, however, as fixed forces require
centering the s3d grid to be turned off and also the l=1 term to be
filtered out!  It is best to just live with the mild disequilibrium.
