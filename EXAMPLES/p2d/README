The files in this directory allow the user to run the standard test of
the code that should reproduce the dominant unstable mode predicted by
linear theory for a Kuzmin-Toomre disk with no random motion.

The script run.s first creates the initial run100.pcs0 file and
then implements pcs2dmp and then galaxy to run this case
for a short period.  The script clean.s will remove most files that
are no longer needed after the run is complete.

Following the execution of this script, an interactive run of progam
analys will reveal very little change to the model until late in the
evolution, since the instability grows from very low amplitude because
of the quiet start.  But option lgan will allow the user to see linear
growth and to get a rough estimate of the growth rate.

The script modefit.s will enable you to derive a more precise value
for the eigenfrequency.  One recent run of this program by the author
yielded the value: 0.5392+0.1584i, while the value predicted by linear
theory is: 0.540+0.158i
