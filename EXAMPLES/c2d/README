The files in this directory allow the user to run a stable, composite
Kalnajs disk model on the 2D Cartesian grid.  It illustrates the use of
correction forces that are created by mkpcs.

The script run.s will first select particles from the DF using program
smooth and then create the initial run100.pcs0 file usng program
mkpcs.  It then implements pcs2dmp and finaly galaxy to run this case
for a short period.

Following the execution of this script, an interactive run of progam
analys should reveal that the model is very close to equilibrium, but
with statistical fluctuations caused by particle shot noise.  This
could be reduced, if desired, by cranking up the number of particles.

The correction forces table can be examined using program corrplt.
