The files in this directory are to enable the user to reproduce the
plots shown in Fig 8 of the manual, purely as a check that parts of
the software are working as advertised.

The script isotropy.s needs a parameter, which must be the run number
of some .dat file in this directory - run201.dat and run301.dat are
supplied.

run201 is 2D Cartesian grid that uses Plummer softening.

run301 is 3D Cartesian grid that has no explicit softening, but the
plot created by the script shows that the Monaghan softening rule with
expsion=1.8 grid spaces is a pretty good fit.
