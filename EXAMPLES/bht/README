The script run.s will first create the initial run100.pcs0 file
containing 10K particles selected from an isotropic Plummer sphere.
It then implements pcs2dmp and finally galaxy to run this case for a
short period using a tree code.  This tree code is horribly slow and
inefficient: it rebuilds the tree at every step and has not been
parallelized.
