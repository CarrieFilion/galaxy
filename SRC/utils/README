This omnibus directory contains the source code for most of the
software that replaces NAG calls (the remaining code is supplied in
the GALAXY directory lib15/)

With the exception of LAPACK, there are scripts named "rebuild" in
every sub-directory from here that will add the compiled object
modules to the omnibus library, which is:

    $HOME/libutils.a

These scripts may be found in the following subdirectories:

 fftpack/sfftpak (GALAXY needs only single precision versions)
 quadpack
 cmlib
 Burkardt

The separate LAPACK library should be created by "make" in its base
directory "lapack" and the library liblapack.a should be moved into
the home directory.  As the BLAS routines are also needed, they can be
added to liblapack.a by running "rebuild" in the directory
lapack/BLAS/SRC
