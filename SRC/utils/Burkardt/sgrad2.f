c     ***  purpose  ***
c
c        this subroutine uses an embellished form of the finite-differ-
c     ence scheme proposed by stewart (ref. 1) to approximate the
c     gradient of the function f(x), whose values are supplied by
c     reverse communication.
c
c     ***  parameter description  ***
c
c  alpha in  (approximate) diagonal elements of the hessian of f(x).
c      d in  scale vector such that d(i)*x(i), i = 1,...,n, are in
c             comparable units.
c   eta0 in  estimated bound on relative error in the function value...
c             (true value) = (computed value)*(1+e),   where
c             abs(e) .le. eta0.
c     fx i/o on input,  fx  must be the computed value of f(x).  on
c             output with irc = 0, fx has been restored to its original
c             value, the one it had when sgrad2 was last called with
c             irc = 0.
c      g i/o on input with irc = 0, g should contain an approximation
c             to the gradient of f near x, e.g., the gradient at the
c             previous iterate.  when sgrad2 returns with irc = 0, g is
c             the desired finite-difference approximation to the
c             gradient at x.
c    irc i/o input/return code... before the very first call on sgrad2,
c             the caller must set irc to 0.  whenever sgrad2 returns a
c             nonzero value for irc, it has perturbed some component of
c             x... the caller should evaluate f(x) and call sgrad2
c             again with fx = f(x).
c      n in  the number of variables (components of x) on which f
c             depends.
c      x i/o on input with irc = 0, x is the point at which the
c             gradient of f is desired.  on output with irc nonzero, x
c             is the point at which f should be evaluated.  on output
c             with irc = 0, x has been restored to its original value
c             (the one it had when sgrad2 was last called with irc = 0)
c             and g contains the desired gradient approximation.
c      w i/o work vector of length 6 in which sgrad2 saves certain
c             quantities while the caller is evaluating f(x) at a
c             perturbed x.
c
c     ***  application and usage restrictions  ***
c
c        this routine is intended for use with quasi-newton routines
c     for unconstrained minimization (in which case  alpha  comes from
c     the diagonal of the quasi-newton hessian approximation).
c
c     ***  algorithm notes  ***
c
c        this code departs from the scheme proposed by stewart (ref. 1)
c     in its guarding against overly large or small step sizes and its
c     handling of special cases (such as zero components of alpha or g).
