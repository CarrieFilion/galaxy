c------------------------------  discussion  ---------------------------
c
c        this routine is like sumsl, except that the subroutine para-
c     meter calcg of sumsl (which computes the gradient of the objec-
c     tive function) is replaced by the subroutine parameter calcgh,
c     which computes both the gradient and (lower triangle of the)
c     hessian of the objective function.  the calling sequence is...
c             call calcgh(n, x, nf, g, h, uiparm, urparm, ufparm)
c     parameters n, x, nf, g, uiparm, urparm, and ufparm are the same
c     as for sumsl, while h is an array of length n*(n+1)/2 in which
c     calcgh must store the lower triangle of the hessian at x.  start-
c     ing at h(1), calcgh must store the hessian entries in the order
c     (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), ...
c        the value printed (by itsum) in the column labelled stppar
c     is the levenberg-marquardt used in computing the current step.
c     zero means a full newton step.  if the special case described in
c     ref. 1 is detected, then stppar is negated.  the value printed
c     in the column labelled npreldf is zero if the current hessian
c     is not positive definite.
c        it sometimes proves worthwhile to let d be determined from the
c     diagonal of the hessian matrix by setting iv(dtype) = 1 and
c     v(dinit) = 0.  the following iv and v components are relevant...
c
c iv(dtol)..... iv(59) gives the starting subscript in v of the dtol
c             array used when d is updated.  (iv(dtol) can be
c             initialized by calling humsl with iv(1) = 13.)
c iv(dtype).... iv(16) tells how the scale vector d should be chosen.
c             iv(dtype) .le. 0 means that d should not be updated, and
c             iv(dtype) .ge. 1 means that d should be updated as
c             described below with v(dfac).  default = 0.
c v(dfac)..... v(41) and the dtol and d0 arrays (see v(dtinit) and
c             v(d0init)) are used in updating the scale vector d when
c             iv(dtype) .gt. 0.  (d is initialized according to
c             v(dinit), described in sumsl.)  let
c                  d1(i) = max(sqrt(abs(h(i,i))), v(dfac)*d(i)),
c             where h(i,i) is the i-th diagonal element of the current
c             hessian.  if iv(dtype) = 1, then d(i) is set to d1(i)
c             unless d1(i) .lt. dtol(i), in which case d(i) is set to
c                  max(d0(i), dtol(i)).
c             if iv(dtype) .ge. 2, then d is updated during the first
c             iteration as for iv(dtype) = 1 (after any initialization
c             due to v(dinit)) and is left unchanged thereafter.
c             default = 0.6.
c v(dtinit)... v(39), if positive, is the value to which all components
c             of the dtol array (see v(dfac)) are initialized.  if
c             v(dtinit) = 0, then it is assumed that the caller has
c             stored dtol in v starting at v(iv(dtol)).
c             default = 10**-6.
c v(d0init)... v(40), if positive, is the value to which all components
c             of the d0 vector (see v(dfac)) are initialized.  if
c             v(dfac) = 0, then it is assumed that the caller has
c             stored d0 in v starting at v(iv(dtol)+n).  default = 1.0.
