The subdirectories here contain the source code for the main Galaxy
library (lib14), the library for running in parallel (lib14_mpi), the
routines writted by Richard James for the 3D Cartesian Poisson solver
(RAJ), single precision versions of the FFTs from FFTPAK (sfftpak), and
the main programs (progs).

You should cd in turn to all subdirectories, saving progs to last, and
issue the command "rebuild" in each to create object libraries from all
this source code.

You should then cd to subdirectory progs, where you can run make.
